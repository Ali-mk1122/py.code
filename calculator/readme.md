Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python script, which includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric calculations, and factorial computation.

▎Overview of the Script

1. Function Definitions:

   • The script defines several functions for arithmetic operations:

     • sum(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.

     • sub(o, p): Returns the result of subtracting p from o.

     • mul(m, n): Returns the product of m and n.

     • div(f, g): Returns the result of dividing f by g.

2. User Input for Arithmetic Operations:

   • The user is prompted to input two numbers (x and y) and select an operation (w).

   • A while True loop is used to check the user's selection:

     • If the selection matches one of the defined operations (sum, sub, mul, or div), the corresponding function is called, and the result is printed.

     • If the selection does not match any operation, the loop breaks without performing any action.

3. Trigonometric Functions:

   • The script defines functions for trigonometric calculations:

     • sin(i): Returns the sine of angle i.

     • cos(k): Returns the cosine of angle k.

     • tan(o): Returns the tangent of angle o.

     • cot(u): This function appears to incorrectly use the arctangent function instead of calculating cotangent. Cotangent is defined as  \cot(x) = 1/(tan(x)) .

4. User Input for Trigonometric Calculations:

   • The user is prompted to enter an angle in degrees (z) and select a trigonometric function (a).

   • The angle is converted to radians using math.radians(z), as trigonometric functions in Python operate in radians.

   • Similar to the arithmetic section, a loop checks the user's selection, calls the appropriate function if valid, and prints the result.

5. Factorial Function:

   • A function named fac(g) is defined to compute the factorial of a number using math.factorial(g).

   • The user is prompted to enter a non-negative integer (A) and select the factorial operation (B).

6. User Input for Factorial Calculation:

   • A loop checks if the user has selected the factorial operation (fac). If so, it calls the factorial function and prints the result.

   • If any other input is provided, the loop breaks without performing any action.

▎Key Features

• Modular Design: Each mathematical operation is encapsulated in its own function, promoting code clarity and reusability.

• User Interaction: The script engages users by prompting for inputs and displaying results based on their choices.

• Error Handling: While basic error handling is present (e.g., checking for valid selections)

▎Conclusion

This script provides a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric calculations, and factorial computations. It serves as a practical example of how to structure a Python program with functions and user input handling.
