Certainly! Let’s break down the provided BMI calculator code step by step and explain its functionality in English.

▎Code Explanation

1. Input for Weight and Height:
      a = float(input("weight"))
   b = float(input("height"))
   

   • The program first prompts the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). These inputs are converted to floating-point numbers and stored in variables a and b.

2. Calculating BMI:
      c = (b * b)
   d = (a / c)
   

   • The variable c calculates the square of the height (b * b).

   • The variable d calculates the BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight / heigh²}


• The result is stored in the variable d.

3. Printing the BMI Value:
      print(d)
   

   • This line prints the calculated BMI value.

4. BMI Classification:
      if(d <= 0.001850): print("Under Weight")
   if (0.00185 < d < 0.00249): print("Normal")
   if (0.00249 < d < 0.00299): print("Over Weight")
   if (0.00299 < d < 0.00349): print("Obese")
   if (0.00185 < d < 0.00249): print("Extremely Obese")
   

   • The code then checks the value of d against various thresholds to classify the individual's weight status:

     • If d is less than or equal to 0.001850, it prints "Under Weight".

     • If d is between 0.00185 and 0.00249, it prints "Normal".

     • If d is between 0.00249 and 0.00299, it prints "Over Weight".

     • If d is between 0.00299 and 0.00349, it prints "Obese".

     • There is an incorrect condition for "Extremely Obese" that overlaps with the "Normal" category.

▎Conclusion

This explanation clarifies how the provided BMI calculator works, highlights its flaws, and offers a corrected approach to classify BMI accurately based on standard thresholds.
