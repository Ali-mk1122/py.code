In this file written in Python, inheritance is used.
The first class is the parent class, which has two methods: the first method is init, which has two attributes, name and age.
The second method is display_info, which prints the attributes.
We have two subclasses named Student and Teacher.
In the Student class, we have two methods: the first method init inherits from the parent class and has two specific attributes named grade and student_id.
The second method display_info overrides the parent method and prints the attributes of the Student class.
In the Teacher class, we also have two methods: the first method init inherits from the parent class and has two specific attributes named subject and salary.
The second method display_info overrides the parent method and prints the attributes of the Teacher class.
